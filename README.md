# CS 410 - Project: Causal Topic Modeling

## Overview

This project is to perform causal topic modeling on MLB (Major League Baseball) articles to analyze the identified hidden trend topics. The performance of the model can be tested by referring the section: [The Software Usage and Testing the Software](#the-software-usage-and-testing-the-software) without installing anything on your machine, which I suspect most people prefer. Additionally, I introduce [The Software Development and Installation](#the-software-development-and-installation) in case you would like to setup the same development environment of this project to run the code.

## Introduction

Each annual MVP (Most Valuable Player) in the 2 leagues is determined by the voters in [the Baseball Writers’ Association of America](https://bbwaa.com/voting-faq). Because of this, topic modeling on the MLB related articles published before the MVP announcement can be used to discover the key topics correlated to the MVP for the year.

## LDA Algorithm

LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation is the most popular topic model and extracts the topics discussed in the documents. In LDA model, each document has a vector of topics as a topic distribution, and each topic has a vector of words as a word distribution. The topic distribution is forced to be drawn from its Dirichlet distribution with the vector of α parameters, and the word distribution is forced to be drawn from its Dirichlet distribution with the vector of β parameters.

__<u>k Topics Probability Distribution (from Dirichlet Distribution) on d-th Document πd</u>__

p(πd)

= (Dirichlet(α1), Dirichlet(α2), ..., Dirichlet(αk))

= (p(πd,1), p(πd,2), ..., p(πd,k))

= (p(θ1), p(θ2), ..., p(θk))

__<u>m Words Distribution on i-th Topic θi</u>__

p(θi)

= (Dirichlet(β1), Dirichlet(β2), ..., Dirichlet(βm))

= (p(w1|θi), p(w2|θi), ..., p(wm|θi))

### Project Steps

This project has 4 different steps:

1. Downloading the Project Source Code
2. Setting Up the Local Environment
3. Web Crawling to Obtain MLB Related Articles
4. Data Preprocessing and Topic Model Analysis

#### 1 Downloading the Project Source Code

Please follow the steps below to download the project zip file.

1. Go to https://github.com/masamip2/CourseProject .
2. Click 'Code' button.
3. Choose 'Download ZIP'.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can clone the project repository, if you prefer to use GIT.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masamip2/CourseProject.git
```

#### 2 Setting Up the Local Environment

#### 2_1 Python and Pip Installation

This project has a working condition on:

- Windows 10 Pro (21H1): Python 3.9.4
- Mac (Catalina 10.15.7): Python 3.9.7
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04): Python 3.9.7

If your Python version is different from any of the versions above, please see the section __Python and Pip Installation__ [Windows](#python-and-pip-installation-on-windows),  [Mac](#python-and-pip-installation-on-mac) and [Linux](#python-and-pip-installation-on-linux) to consider installing the supported version of Python for this project. Pip is already installed with Python 3.4+.

#### 2_2 Finding Out Available Python and Pip Versions

If Python and Pip versions are not up to date, please see the section __Finding Out Available Python and Pip Versions__ [Windows](#finding-out-available-python-and-pip-versions-on-windows), [Mac](#finding-out-available-python-and-pip-versions-on-mac), [Linux](#finding-out-available-python-and-pip-versions-on-linux) to upgrade the versions.

#### 2_3 Jupyter Notebook Installation

If Jupyter Notebook is not installed or the version is not up to date, please see the section __Jupyter Notebook Installation__ [Windows](#jupyter-notebook-installation-on-windows), [Mac](#jupyter-notebook-installation-on-mac), [Linux](#jupyter-notebook-installation-on-linux).

#### 2_4 Setting Up Virtual Environment

Please see the section __Setting Up Virtual Environment__ [Windows](#setting-up-virtual-environment-on-windows), [Mac](#setting-up-virtual-environment-on-mac), [Linux](#setting-up-virtual-environment-on-linux) to setup the virtual environment 'mlb' for this project. Venv is already installed with Python 3.3+.

#### 3 Web Crawling to Obtain MLB Related Articles

This step is __OPTIONAL__, because it will take about 1 hour 40 minutes to complete web crawling. Also, due to the available articles being updated on the corresponding sites, the fetched articles will be slightly different from the datasets already provided in this project. Moreover, there is a chance that the scraper.py has to run multiple times on some of those article sites where the advertisements and the pop-ups maybe cause some kind of issue.

#### 3_1 ChromeDriver Installation

1. Check your Chrome version: Click right-top corner on the browser for settings.

2. 'Help' -> 'About Google Chrome' -> Version (the examples below):

- Windows 10 Pro (21H1): Version 94.0.4606.81 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- Mac (Catalina 10.15.7): Version 95.0.4638.69 (Official Build) (x86_64)
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04): Version 95.0.4638.54 (Official Build) (64-bit)

3. Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads , click a link for the downloading page, download the appropriate chromedriver zip file, unzip the file and place the executable driver file at 1 level above the scraper.py:

- Windows 10 Pro (21H1): ChromeDriver 94.0.4606.61 -> chromedriver_win32.zip -> chromedriver.exe
- Mac (Catalina 10.15.7): ChromeDriver 95.0.4638.54 -> chromedriver_mac64.zip -> chromedriver
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04): ChromeDriver 95.0.4638.17 -> chromedriver_linux64.zip -> chromedriver

4. Alternatively, place the driver file at any applicable place and modify a constant 'CHROME_DRIVER_PATH' in the scraper.py for the file path.

5. __NOT ON__ the virtual environment 'mlb', run the chromedriver:

- Windows 10 Pro (21H1): Double-click the chromedriver.exe
- Mac (Catalina 10.15.7): Right-click the chromedriver -> Open -> Open
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04): Type \~/Documents/CS410/chromedriver in terminal and hit enter key

#### 3_2 Start Web Crawling

__ON__ the virtual environment 'mlb', run the command like below where an argument of site_name has to be replaced by Reuters, MLB, WSJ, NYTimes or ESPN.

#### Windows 10 Pro (21H1) Environment

```bash
py -3.9 scraper.py ESPN # example: web crawling on ESPN.com
```

#### Mac (Catalina 10.15.7) Environment

```bash
python3 scraper.py ESPN # example: web crawling on ESPN.com
```

_NOTE1_: For the first time, a popup will show up asking "'Google Chrome' would like to access files in your Documents folder."

#### Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) Environment

```bash
python3.9 scraper.py ESPN # example: web crawling on ESPN.com
```

_NOTE2_: If the script stops very quickly or gets stuck, please run scraper.py multiple times for the particular article site where the advertisements and the pop-ups maybe cause some kind of issue.

_NOTE3_: Once web crawling is done, you can stop the chromedriver by 'Ctrl' + 'c'.

#### 4 Data Preprocessing and Topic Model Analysis

#### 4_1 Start Jupyter Notebook

__NOT ON__ the virtual environment 'mlb', run the command like below to start Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/CS410/CourseProject-main # go to a suitable directory for the root of Jupyter Notebook tree
jupyter notebook
```

_NOTE1_: In case a browser for Jupyter Notebook does not open up on Mac, copy and paste the url for the host like `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token={48_Alphanumeric_Characters}` on a browser url bar.

#### 4_2 Run mlb notebook

1. On the automatically opened Jupyter Notebook in a browser, navigate to the file 'mlb.ipynb' and click it.

2. Make sure that the virtual environment 'mlb' has already been created in the step [Setting Up Virtual Environment](#setting_up_virtual_environment), click 'Kernel' -> 'Change kernel' -> select 'mlb'.

3. Click 'Kernel' -> 'Restart & Clear Output' -> click 'Restart and Clear All Outputs' to clear cache.

4. Click 'Cell' -> 'Run All' (alternatively, click 'Run' for each cell one by one).

_NOTE1_: Once all the tasks in Jupyter Notebook are done, you can stop the Jupyter Notebook by 'Ctrl' + 'c'.

_NOTE2_: In 'mlb.ipynb', please ignore one type of DeprecationWarning which is unable to be suppressed when the function gensimvis.prepare() is called for the first time in Python 3.9.7.
